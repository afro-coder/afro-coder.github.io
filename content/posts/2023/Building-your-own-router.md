To whoever got that reference congrats your probably old.
So yes in a series of unfortunate incidents, I lost my router to the "Act of God" kind of warranty that is never under warranty. However, this sent me into Panic mode, because I had things planned that involved having internet!

However since it was a long weekend and many people lost their routers too, the local shops were all out of stock and Amazon was going to deliver on Monday.

So I did the next smartest thing I started looking on how to build a router because I've been quite interested in Hardware projects and I had recently purchased a switch so I had that handy.

So let's get started:
Things used:
- OpenWRT
- Raspberry Pi 2b, you could use a zero with a USB ethernet cable too.
- A USB adapter for an extra internet port
- A network switch to extend to more connections(Optional)
- A wifi adapter(Optional)
